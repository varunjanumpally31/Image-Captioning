a) team_id_G-35_a: In this file CNN Encoder and RNN Decoder are used. This file has been ran on Kaggle T4 GPU and we have ensured that the file has never crossed RAM limit of 15GB by using only one GPU processor of 15GB RAM even though there are 2 such GPUs provided by Kaggle. Please run all the cells in the notebook file in the same order as they are written.
b) team_id_G-35_a: In this file ViT Encoder and RNN Decoder are used. This file has been ran on Kaggle T4 GPU and we have ensured that the file has never crossed RAM limit of 15GB by using only one GPU processor of 15GB RAM even though there are 2 such GPUs provided by Kaggle. Please run all the cells in the notebook file in the same order as they are written.
